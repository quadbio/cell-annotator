🧬 CellAnnotator is an [scverse ecosystem package](https://scverse.org/packages/#ecosystem), designed to annotate cell types in scRNA-seq data based on marker genes using LLMs, currenlty supporting OpenAI, Google (Gemini) and Anthropic (Claude) models.


## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **LLM-agnostic backend**: Seamlessly use models from OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and Gemini (Google) — just set your provider and API key.
- 🧬 **Automatically annotate cells** including type, state, and confidence fields.
- 🔄 **Consistent annotations** across all samples in your study.
- 🧠 **Infuse prior knowledge** by providing information about your biological system.
- 📦 **Structured outputs** for reliable results (see e.g. [OpenAI structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)).
- 🧩 **Supports datasets with limited feature sets** (e.g., imaging-based spatial transcriptomics): marker gene lists are filtered to the actual gene set in your data.
- ⚡ **Quickly generate pre-integration cell type labels** to score or guide your integration (e.g. [scIB metrics](https://scib-metrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [scPoli](https://docs.scarches.org/en/latest/), [scANVI](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/api/reference/scvi.model.SCANVI.html)).

> ℹ️ **Note:** This package is based on output generated by large language models and might **sometimes make mistakes**. We use some safeguards, like anchoring the tool in a multi-step process, and using structured output predictions, but mistakes are still possible. We recommend using this tool as a first step in an annotation workflow to generate an initial, coarse set of annotations that must be further refined.


## 📦 Installation


You need to have 🐍 Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system.
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge][].


### 🚀 PyPI


Install by running:

```bash
pip install cell-annotator
```


### 🛠️ Development version


To install the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/quadbio/cell-annotator), run

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/quadbio/cell-annotator.git@main
```


## 🏁 Getting started


After installation, head over to the LLM provider of your choice to generate an API key 🔑. For example:

- OpenAI: [API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)
- Google (Gemini): [API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
- Anthropic (Claude): [API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/get-started)


🔒 Keep this key private and don't share it with anyone. `CellAnnotator` will try to read the key as an environmental variable - either expose it to the environment yourself, or store it as an `.env` file anywhere within the repository where you conduct your analysis and plan to run `CellAnnotator`. The package will then use [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to export the key from the `env` file as an environmental variable.


Here's the simplest way to annotate your data:

```python
from cell_annotator import CellAnnotator

cell_ann = CellAnnotator(
    adata, species="human", tissue="heart", cluster_key="leiden", sample_key="samples",
).annotate_clusters()
```


By default, this will store annotations in `adata.obs['cell_type_predicted']`. Head over to our 📚 [tutorials](https://cell-annotator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/index.html) to see more advanced use cases, and learn how to adapt this to your own data. You can run `CellAnnotator` for just a single sample of data, or across multiple samples. In the latter case, it will attempt to harmonize annotations across samples.


## 💸 Costs and models


The default model is currently `gpt-4o-mini`, which is included in [OpenAI's Free Usage Tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits). Thus, you can get started for free and experiment with our 📚 [tutorials](https://cell-annotator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tutorials/index.html) and with your own data. If you want to get accurate cell type labels for complex tissues, we strongly recommend using more powerful models, like `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, etc, or reasoning models like `o3-mini`, for which you will have to pay a small fee to OpenAI. As an orientation, running both tutorials with `o3-mini` will cost around 1 USD. Take a look at the [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to learn more about the different available models.


## 🔐 Data privacy


This package sends cluster marker genes to OpenAI, but no actual gene expression values. In addition, it sends the `species` and `tissue` you define. Make sure your usage of this package aligns with your institution's guidelines on data privacy and AI models.
